# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning â€“ Learning Progress  
A collection of my daily explorations and practical implementations in **Machine Learning**, as part of my AI-Research-Journey-by-KartikSaroop.

## ðŸ§© Experiment 1 â€“ Data Scaling Techniques (StandardScaler & MinMaxScaler)
In machine learning value of features may have different ranges and units. This variation can impact negatively on the performance of algorithms like KNN, SVM or Logistic Regression. To avoid this issue feature scaling is used to standardize data.[StandardScaler.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23092023/StandardScaler.py)

### 🗓️ Day 1 – Model Evaluation & Cross Validation 
**Date:** October 12, 2025 

**Topics Covered:** 
- Studied **Model Evaluation** methods in Machine Learning
- Learned about **Cross-Validation**, its **types**, and specifically **K-Fold Cross Validation**
- Implemented **K-Fold Cross Validation** in **Python** using scikit-learn 

**Reflection:** > Learned how cross-validation improves model reliability by reducing overfitting and providing a better estimate of model performance.

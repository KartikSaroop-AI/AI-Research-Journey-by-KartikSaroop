# ðŸ§  Neural Networks â€“ My Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Neural Networks Learning Log**, where I document everything I learn and build while exploring the foundations and advanced concepts of **Deep Learning**.  

This file serves as a structured collection of my **daily experiments**, **hands-on implementations**, and **conceptual understanding** of how neural networks learn, generalize, and make intelligent predictions. Each experiment focuses on a specific theme â€” from basic architectures to advanced models like **CNNs**, **RNNs**, and **Transformers** â€” with clear explanations, practical code, and reflections.

  ### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This File
- To **learn by doing** â€” implement every concept I study using real datasets and TensorFlow/Keras.  
- To track my **progressive growth** from simple neural architectures to complex deep learning models.  
- To build a **public learning portfolio** that showcases my dedication, curiosity, and problem-solving ability in AI and Machine Learning.  
- To make my repository a **self-contained resource** that others can follow, replicate, and learn from.

1. **Objective** â€“ What Iâ€™m trying to learn or build.  
2. **Concepts Learned** â€“ Core ideas, math intuition, and architecture summary.  
3. **Python/Jupyter Implementation** â€“ Practical hands-on code.  
4. **Reflections** â€“ Insights, challenges, and next steps.  
5. **Linked Files** â€“ Direct access to the notebooks or scripts.

## ðŸ§© Experiment 1 â€“ Neural Networks with MNIST Classification  
Implemented a fully connected neural network on the MNIST dataset using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
Explored concepts of feedforward networks, activation functions, loss computation, and performance metrics.

## ðŸ§© Experiment 2 â€“ TensorFlow Callbacks (EarlyStopping & ModelCheckpoint) 
**TensorFlow callbacks** for optimizing model training â€” specifically:  
- **EarlyStopping** to prevent overfitting by halting training when validation performance stops improving.  
- **ModelCheckpoint** to automatically save the best-performing model during training.

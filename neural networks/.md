# ðŸ§  Neural Networks â€“ Experiments and Implementations  
This section documents my hands-on experiments with **Neural Networks** using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  
Each experiment focuses on a specific deep learning concept, covering both **theory** and **implementation**.


## ðŸ§© Experiment 1 â€“ Neural Networks with MNIST Classification
**Objective:** Build and train a fully connected neural network to classify MNIST digits.  
**Key Concepts:** Input/Hidden/Output layers, ReLU, Softmax, Cross-Entropy loss, Adam, Accuracy.
